CallBacks

Callbacks are used to manage asynchronous flows such as 
network I/0, database access, or user input

cons
Callback hell
Can run more than once
Change error semantics (callbacks break the traditional try/catch mechanism
    and rely on the programmer to chekc for errors and pass them around)
Concurrency get increasingly complicated 

//////////////////////////

Promises 

Can save us from callbacks.
Calling an asynchronous function immediately returns a "promise" that will eventually be
either esolved with the result of the operation or rejected with an error. The pending 
promise can be used as a placeholder for the final vlaue. 

pros
More clear code (looks more synchronous)
no need for nesting blocks (less state)

cons
yield only a single value 
useless for recurrent events (e.g. mouse clicks, streams of data coming from server, because
    we will have to create a promise for each separate event instead of creating a promise
    that handles the stream of events as it comes )



////////////////////////////
Event Emitters

In JS event programming is commong and generally a good practice

cons
Events force side effects (ignore their return values)
Not first-class values (click events can't be passed as a param or manipulated)
It's easy to miss events if we start litening too late



//////////////////////
Reactive Programming

Create, Transform and React to streams of data. 
e.g. Mouse clicks, network request, arrays of strings , etc 

Focuses on propagating changes without our having to explicitly how the propagation ahppens.

========================

An Observable represents a stream of data. Programs can be expressed largely as streams of data. 


Reactive Programming - Let’s start by considering the quintessential example of a reactive
system: the spreadsheet. We all have used them, but we rarely stop and
think how shockingly intuitive they are. Let’s say we have a value in
cell A1 of the spreadsheet. We can then reference it in other
cells in the spreadsheet, and whenever we change A1, every cell
depending on A1 will automatically update its own value.


Your mouse becomes a database

In reactive programming, we see mouse clicks as a continuous
stream of values that we can query and manipulate. Thinking
about a stream of values instead of discrete values opens up a
whole new way to program, one in which we can manipulate entire
sequences of values that haven’t been created yet.

Rx pattern = Observer + Iterator pattern
RxJs is push-based (think push notification, server sends update to client instead
    of client having to poll the server for these updates ).
    Source of events (observable) will push values to consumer (subscriber) without
    the consumer requesting the next value

Subscriptions are the equivalent of listeners in Observer pattern.


So far it doesn’t seem very different from the
traditional Observer pattern. But actually there are two essential
differences:
An Observable doesn’t start streaming items until it has at least
one Observer subscribed to it.
Like iterators, an Observable can signal when the sequence is completed. 

Observer interace contains 3 methods: - they are optional i believe
next
complete
error

Observables are just streams of events that we
transform, combine, and query. It doesn’t matter whether we’re
dealing with simple Ajax callbacks or processing gigabytes of data
in Node.js. The way we declare our flows is the same. Once we think
in streams, our programs become simpler.

 Most used operators like any language with collection-processing are
 map, filter, reduce

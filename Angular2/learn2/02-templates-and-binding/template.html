<!-- Following kept free of styling to aid in demonstration -->
<h4>My {{version}} Angular 2 App</h4>

<p>Hello, {{person}}</p>

<p [innerText]="person"></p>

<h4>Expressions</h4>
<p>3 + 4 = {{ 3 + 4 }}</p>
<p>My mother is {{ personObject.mother + "!!" }}</p>

<p>Function result is {{ calculate() }}</p>
<!-- shouldn't call this function in the view, so anuglar doesn't have to
update over and over again.  How do we fix this?!? just call this
in the component, grab the value, then put it out here. Can impact
performance, if you're running a big loop or something of that sort -->

<p>In some earlier alphas, this would be an error:</p>
<p>Made up variable: {{ madeUpVariableName }}</p>

<h4>Sanitization</h4>
<p>As of rc-4, this is sanitized by <b>Angular</b>:</p>
<p [innerHtml]="stringWithHtml"></p>

<p>If you bind to innerText, the <b>browser</b> does it (note the different output):</p>
<p [innerText]="stringWithHtml"></p>


<h4>New!!</h4>
<p> Hey, {{animal}} </p>
<!--<p>{{fooNum}}</p> HOW WOULD I GET THIS TO WORK!!?!?!? -->

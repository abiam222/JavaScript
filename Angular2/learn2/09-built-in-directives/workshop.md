# Workshop for this step

Your customer is pleased with the progress you have made so far and is
ready to switch their focus to the archetype list. They would like to
see the list populated with some example archetypes. You will need to
find or create some data that shows some basic stats for a collection
of entities. For convenience, we have provided seom of the data used
by SWAPP in the learn2 directory under demo-data. You can use this
data or copy its structure if you would like to create your own
dataset.

## Step 1: Update the archetypeList Component to Include Data

Once you have a collection of data, add it to the archetypeList
Component.

## Step 2: Use ngFor to Display Each Entry in the Collection

You have not been given all of the tools you need to pass the data for
each entry into an archetype display just yet. For now, repeat a
simple HTML structure that allows you to display the name and one or
two stats for each entry.

The customer for this application is no different than any other. They
have come back to you and added a second requirement at the last
minute.

The UI/UX team is worried about the users attempting to create a
character with no name. They would like you to add a message that
informs the user that a character name is required. This message
should appear next to the character name input and should be removed
once the user has entered a name.

## Step 3: Add Warning Message to characterName Component

Add the HTML for the warning message to the template.

## Step 4: Use ngIf to remove the message when it is no longer needed

## (BONUS)

Hide the Filter Criteria Display unless a user has modified one of the
default selections.

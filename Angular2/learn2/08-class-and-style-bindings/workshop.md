# Workshop for this step

The UI/UX team has decided that the users might benefit from styling
the filter buttons based on the current selection. Add a CSS class
that changes the appearance of the buttons based upon the current
state of the application. If a filter button is clicked, the class
should be applied to indicate this fact visually.

Step 1: Create a new CSS class to apply.

Step 2: Use ngClass or [class.xyz] to conditionally apply that style
to the appropriate buttons.

//========================================FUNCTIONS================================================

//Functions in JS are objects
//Objects are collections of name/value pairs having a hidden link
//to a prototoype object.  Objects produced from object literals
//are lilnked to Object.prototype.  Function objects are linked
//to Fucntion.prototype(which is itself linked to Object.protytype)
//Every function is also created with two additional hidden properties: the 
//functions context and the code that implements the functions behaviour
//every function object is also created with a prototype property.
//its value is an object with a contructor property whose vale is the function
//This is distinct from the hidden link to Function.prototype.  

var add = function(a,b){
	return a+b;
}


//Invocation
//invoking a function suspends the execution of the current function, 
//passing control and parameters to the new function
//this and arguments

//Method Invocation Pattern
//When a function is stored as a property of an object, we call it a method
//When a method is invoked, this is bound to that object.  

var myObject = {
	value:0,
	increment: function(inc){
		this.value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
	}
};

myObject.increment();
//document.writeln(myObject.value);

myObject.increment(2);
//document.writeln(myObject.value);

var sum = add(3,4);
document.writeln(sum);
//when a function is invoked with this pattern, 'this' is bound to
//the global object 


myObject.double = function(){
	var that = this; //workaround

	var helper = function(){
		that.value = add(that.value, that.value);
	};
	helper();//invoke helper as a function

	
};
//invoke double as a method
myObject.double();
//document.writeln(myObject.getValue());



//==================================CONSTRUCTORS==================================================
//Constructor Invocation Pattern
//JS is a prototypal inheritance language, that means that objects
//can inherit properties directly from other objects.  The language is class-free


//Create a constructor function called Quo
//It makes an object with a status property

var Quo = function (string){
	this.status = string;
}

//Give all instances of Quo a public method
//called get_status

Quo.prototype.get_status = function(){
	return this.status;
};

//Make an instance of Quo

var myQuo = new Quo("confused");//new makes an instance

document.writeln(myQuo.get_status());//confused
/*document.writeln(myQuo.status);*/




//the "apply" method lets us construct an array of arguments to use to invoke
//a function.  It also lets us choose the value of "this".  The "apply" method takes two parameters.
//The first is the value that hsould be bound to this.  The second is an array of parameters

//Make an array of 2 numbers and add them
var array = [3,4];
var sum = add.apply(null,array);


//Make an object with a status member
var statusObject = {
	status: 'A-OK'//has to be same as 'this.status', cause thats what get_status is calling(237)
};

//statusObjects doesn't inherit from Quo.prototype
//but we can invoke the get_status method on
//statusObject even though statusObject doesn't
//have a get_status method

var status = Quo.prototype.get_status.apply(statusObject);
//status is 'A-OK'


document.writeln(Quo.prototype.get_status.apply(statusObject));





//Return
//The "return" statement can be used to cause the function to return early.
//Whsen "return" is executed, the function returns immediately withoug executing the 
//remaining statements
//A function always returns a value.  If the "return" value is not specified, then "undefined" is returned
//If the function was invoked with the "new" prefix and the return value is not an object, then "this"(new object) is returned


//Augmenting Types
//Adding a method to Object.prototype makes that method available to all objects
//This also works for functions, arrays, strings, numbres, regular expressions, 
//and booleans

Function.prototype.method = function(name,func){
	this.prototype[name] = func;
	return this;
};

//By augmenting Function.prototye with a "method", we no longer have to type the
//name of the "prototype" property.  That big of ugliness can now be hiddenss


//Scope
//JS doesn't have block scope even though its block syntax
//suggests that is does.  This confusion can be a source of errors
//JS does have function scope.  That means that the parameters and vairbles
//defined in a function are not visible outside of the function, and that 
//a variable defined anywhere whitin a function is visible everywhere within the 
//function
//In modern languages, it is recommended that variables be declared as late
//as possible, at the first point of use.  That turns out to be bad advice for JS
//because it lacks block scope.  So instead, it is best to declare all of the variables
//used in a functoin at the top of the function body


//You can also do (function() { }())//to protect scope of everything ()) will
//cause for the function to just run


//Closure
//The good news about scope is that inner functions get access to the parameters and
//variables of the functions they are defined within(with the exception of this or arguments)



//A more interesting case is when the inner function has a longer lifetime than
//its outer function
//Earlier, we made a "myObject" that had a value and an increment method. Suppose we
//wanted to protect the value from unauthorized changes.

//Instead of initializing myObject with an object literal, we will initialize myObect by
//calling a function that returns an object literal.  That function defines a value variable.
//That variable is always available to the increment and getValue method, but
//the functions scope keeps it hidden from the rest of the program

var myObject = function(){
	var value = 0;

	return{
		increment: function(inc){
			value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
		},
		getValue: function(){
			return value;
		}
	};
	
}();


//we are not assigning a function to myObject. We are assigning the result of
//invoking that function.  Notice the () on the last line.  The function returns an
//object containing two methods, and those methods continue to enjoy the privilege of
//access to the value variable


//The Quo constructor from earlier in this chapter produced an object with a status property
//and a get_status method.  Why would you call a getter method on a property you could access directly?
//It would be more useful if the status property were private.  So, lets define a different kind of quo
//function to do that

var quo = function(status){
	return{
		get_status: function(){
			return status;
		}
	};
};//returns object

//Make an instance of quo

var myQuo = quo("amazed");


document.writeln(myQuo.status);

//sets status as private
//hence using "quo('amaxed') set 
//the parameter to private.  Only way you can
//retrieve it is by using the getter method
//that function does the both setter and getter



//This quo function is designed to be used witout the new prefix, so the name
//is not capitalized.  When we call quo, it returns a new object containing a 
//get_status method.  A reference to that object is stored in myQuo.  The get)status
//method still has privileged access to quo's status property even though quo has already returned.
//get_status doesn't have access to copy of the parameter; it has access to the parameter
//itself.  This is possible because the function has access to the context in
//which it was cretaed. This is called closure

//Another example

//Define a function that sets a DOM node's color
//to yellow and then fades it to white
var fade = function(node){
	var level = 1;
	var step = function(){
		var hex = level.toString(16);
		node.style.backgorundColor = '#FFFF' + hex + hex;
		if(level < 15){
			level += 1;
			setTimeout(step, 100);
		}
	};
	setTimeout(step, 100);
};

fade(document.body);




//Callbacks
//asynchronous and synchronous calls

//synchronous
/*request = prepare_the_request();
response = send_request_synchronously(request);
display(response);

//asynchrounous
request = prepare_the_request();
send_request_asynchronously(request, function(response){
	display(response);
});*/



//Module
//we can use functions and closure to make modules.  A module is a function or object
//that presents an interface but that hides its state and implementation
//By using functions to prduce modules, we can almost completely eliminate our use of global
//variables, thereby mitigating one of JS worst features 


String.method('deentityify', function(){
	//The entity table. It maps entity names to
	//characters

	var entity = {
		quot: ' " ',
		lt: '<',
		gt: '>'
	};
//Return the deentittyify method

return function(){
	//This is the deentifyify method.  It calls the sting/
	//replace method, looking for substrings that start
	//with '&' and end with ';' If the characters in
	//between are in the entity table, then replace the
	//entity with the character from the table.  
	return this.replace(/&[^&;]+);/g,
		function (a,b){
			var r = entity[b];
			return typeof r === 'string' ? r : a;
		}
	  );
	};
}());


//The module pattern takes advantage of function scope and closure to create
//relationships that are binding and private.   In this exampe, only the deentityify 
//method has access tot eh entity data structure 


//The general pattern of a module is a function that defines private variables
//and functions; creates privileged functions which, through closure, will
//have access to the private variables and functions; and that returns the privileged
//functions or stores them in an accessible place

//Us of the Module pattern can eliminate the use of global variables(not good)
//it promotes information hiding and other good design practices.  It is very
//effective in encapsulation applications and other singletons.  

//it can also be used to produce objects that are secure.

var serial_maker = function(){

	//Produce an object that produces unique strings. A
	//unique string is made up of two parts: a prefix

	//strings

seqer.set_prefix = ('Q');
seqer.set_seq = (1000);
var unique = seqer.gensym();



//Cascade
//Some methods don't have a return value.  e.g. it is typical for methods
//that set or change the state of an object to return nothing.  If we have those
//methods return 'this' instead of 'undefined' we can enable cascades. In cascade, we can call
//many methods on the same object in sequence in a  single statement.

//Curry
//Functions are values, and we can manipulate function values in interesting ways
//Currying allows us to produce a new function by combining a function and an argument

//Memoization
//Function can use object to remmeber the results of previous operations, making it
//possible to avoid uneccessary work.  This optimization is called memoization.
//JS objects and arrays are very oconvenient for this



//============================================INHERTITANCE========================================================


//Inheritance


//JS,being a loosely typed language, never casts.  The lineage of an object
//is irrrelevant.  What matters about an object is what it can do not waht it is descended
//from
//Much more complicated constructions are possible, but it's usually best to keep it simple
//JS is prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects

//Pseudoclassical
//jS is conflicted about its prototypal nature.  Its prorotype mechanism is obscrured 
//by some complicated syntactic business that looks vaguely classical.  
//Instead of having objects inherit directly from other objects, an unnecessary
//level of indirection is inserted such that objects are produced by constructor functoins.

//When a function object is created, the Function constructor that produces the 
//function object runs some code like this:
//this.prototype = {constructor: this};


Function.method('new', function(){

	//Create a new object that inherits from the
	//Constructor's prototype

	var that = Object.create(this.prototype);

	//Invoke the constructor, bing -this- to the new object

	var other = this.apply(that,arguments);

	//If its return value isn't an object, substitute the new object

	return (typeof other === 'object' && other) || that;
});

//we can define a constructor and augment its prototype

var Mammal = function(name){
	this.name = name;
};

Mammal.prototype.get_name = function(){
	return this.name;
};

Mammal.prototype.says = function(){
	return this.saying || '';
};

//now we can make an instance:

var myMammal = new Mammal('Herb the Mammal');
var name = myMammal.get_name(); //'herb the mammal'

//we can make another pseudoclass that inherits from Mammal by defining its constructor
//function and replacing its prototype with an instance of Mammal:

var Cat = function(name){
	this.name = name;
	this.saying = 'meow';
};

//replace cat.prototype with a new instance of Mammal

Cat.prototype = new Mammal();

//augment the new prototype with
//purr and get_name methods

Cat.prototype.purr = function(n){
	var i,s = '';
	for(i=0;i<n;i += 1){
		if (s){
			s +='-';
		}
		s +='r';

var says = myCat.says();//'meow'
var purr = myCat.purr(5); //'r-r-r-r'
var name = myCat.get_name();//'meow Henrietta meow'

document.writeln(name); 

//The pseudoclassical pattern was intended to look sort of object-oriented,
//but it is looking quite alien.  We can hide some of the ugliness by using the
//method method and defining an inherits method:



//our inherits and method methods return "this", allowing us to program in a cascade
//style.  We can now make our Cat with one statement

/*

}).method('get_name',function(){

	});
*/


//there is no privacy though; all properties are public.  There is no access to super methods
//If you forget to include the new prefix when calling a constructor function, the this will
//not be bound to a new object.  This will be bound to the global object, so instead of augmenting your new object
//you will be clobbering global variables.  
//To mitigate this problem, there is a convention that all construcotr functoins are named with an  initial capital, and that
//nothing else is spelled with an initial capital.  This gives us a prayer that visual inspection can find a missing new
//A much better alternative is to not use "new" at all


//Back to Constructors(object specifiers)
//it sometimes happens that a constructors is given a very large number of parameters
//this can be troublesome because it can be very difficult to remember the order of the arguments

//the arguments can be listed in any order, arguments can be left out if the constructor
//is smart about defaults, adn the code is much easier to read


//prototypal
//in a purely prototypal pattern, we dispanse with classes.  We focus instead on the objects
//Prototypal inheritance is conceptually simpler than classical inheritance:a
//new object can inherit the properties of an old object.  
//you can make a useful object.  you can then make many more object that are like that one.
//the classification process of breaking an application down into a set of nested abstract classes can be completely avoided

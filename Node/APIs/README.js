This is a Node application that uses APIs as the main objective.  I made this application
to start learning REST APIs with Node and Express.  There are three directories.  

	1. noTest - this directory is the simplest API Node application, 
		with routes and models.
	2.  Test - this directory has the same code as 'noTest' but test
		 are added and some code changes to
		the application to make those test work.
	3. HATEOUT - this directory uses HETEOAS ( hypermedia ) content along with
		the same code as the above two directories.

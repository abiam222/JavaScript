==============LINE CHARTS================

Bar charts work great for visualizing a modest amount of data, but for more significat
amouts of data, a line chart can present the information much more effectively.  Line charts are
good at revealing overall trends in data without bogging the user down in individual data points.  
Also line charts help identify patterns between two sets of data (or multiple)

Individual data points are not the focus of the visualization.  Rather, we want to show trends - the trends of each data set as well as that data sets correlation to the others.  Connecting the points with lines leads the user right ot those trends and to the heart of our visualization.  


==========PIE CHARTS=============
Pie charts don't get a lot of love.  They're rarely the most effective way to communicate data. We humans aren't good at judging the relative size of areas.  If we really want to compare five values, a bar chart works better.  With a bar chart we only have to compare one dimension - height. 
If you're comparing different values against one another, consider a bar chart first. 
One case, where pie charts can be quite effective is when we want to compare a single partial value against a whole. For example, we want to visualize the percentage of the worlds population that lives in poverty.  In that case, a pie chart may work quite well.   
(A proportion of a single value compared to the whole)


=============SCATTER CHARTS==================

A bar chart is often most effective fo visualizeing data that consists primarily of a single quantity.  But if we want to explore the relationship between two different quantities, a scatter chart can be more effective.  For Example, we wish to visualize the relationhip between a contrys health-care spending(one quantity) and itslife expectancy(the sencond quantity)


=================BUBBLE CHARTS=====================
Traditional scatter charts, like those described in the previous example, show the relationship betwen two values: the x-axis and the y-axis.  Someimes, however, two values are not adequate for the data we want to visualize.  If we need to visualize three variables, we could use a scatter plot framework for two of the variables and then vary the size of the opints according ot the third variable.  The resulting chart is a bubble chart

/*

Template driven forms, as the name suggests, are forms built entirely in your UI. 
This is the typical way we built forms in the past and is useful for building very simple forms in Angular 2.

Model driven or reactive forms, while similar to template driven forms, add an additional layer of complexity and 
functionality by having you to declare the model of the form in your component class.
